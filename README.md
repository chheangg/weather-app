# weather-app
A simple, basic, and fast weather looking app that can search up a city's weather and forecast it for over a period of 5 days. Included both Fahrenheit and Celsius switch!

This is for a project in the Odin Project. If you like it, you can check out how I made it, it's messy but it'll be refactored soon.
